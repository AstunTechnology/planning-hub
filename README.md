# Planning Hub

Aggregate and publish planning applications based on the [UK national planning schema](http://schemas.opendata.esd.org.uk/PlanningApplications) maintained by [Local Government Association](http://www.local.gov.uk/).

The project consists of three main components:

* Aggregation of planning feeds from planning authorities
* Publishing API to allow access to all applications and optionally filter (available under [./api](./api))
* Web map to display applications queried from the Publishing API that can be easily embedded in any web page (available under [./api](./api))
